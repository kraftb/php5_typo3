To build this module use the following commands in a shell.
Of course the PHP5 building environment must be properly working.

phpize5
./configure
make
sudo make install

The last command (sudo make install) can be left out if you do not wish to install the experimental version of this
PHP module to your PHP module directory. You can also test the module by using appropriate PHP commandline arguments.
